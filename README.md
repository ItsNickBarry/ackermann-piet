## The Ackermann Function
The Ackermann function, named for Wilhelm Ackermann, is an example of a total computable function which is not primitive recursive.  As the value of its arguments increases linearly, the time required to compute it increases superexponentially.

## Piet
Piet is a stack-based programming language which consists of images rather than text.  It was written by David Morgan-Mar, prolific author of esoteric programming languages, and named after Dutch painter Piet Mondrian.  The interpreter provides a formalistic analysis of a program's content.  Iconographic elements are analogous to code comments.
